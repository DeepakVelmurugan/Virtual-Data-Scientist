# Virtual Data Scientist

A python flask based website :globe_with_meridians: for basic data processing and prediction.<br>
<b>Users don't need to code just given in some inputs and find which works and which does not :cowboy_hat_face:.</b><br>
Make sure to input csv files :white_check_mark:. It only works if a target variable is known.<br>

<h4>Kinds of functions that can be done:</h4>

- Preprocessing
    - Drop columns with missing values
    - Imputation
    - Extension to imputation
- Splitting
    - Train-test split
    - k-fold cross-validation
    - Stratified k-fold cross-validation
    - Stratified k-fold cross-validation for regression
- Predicting
    - Random Forest Regressor
    - Logistic Regression
    - Linear Regression
    - Extreme Gradient boosting(XGBoost)
    - Decision Tree Classifier
    - Neural Networks :alien:
<br>

Currently the above mentioned functions are present, it may increase in the future :thinking:.<br> 
If you need any new functionality in this pipeline just raise a issue in this repo.

<strong>The website is not deployed yet</strong><br>
<i>After some minor checks it will be up soon.</i>
